    <p> These lab environments are provided in conjunction with CloudShare. These offer us a space to deliver repeatable and scalable environments for many simultaneous users.</p>
    <p>As the trainee, you can interact with the lab using your browser, set the language of your choice (for the environment), and troubleshoot any Internet connectivity issues you may experience. Your environment is provisioned for some time (currently, this is a total runtime of 2 weeks, but this is subject to change), and you can dip in and out of the lab as you wish as it will automatically suspend after 1 hour of inactivity. If things go wrong or you wish to start over, simply reset the environment.</p>
    <p>You can request help and chat with instructors, and the instructors can see and interact with your environment if you need remote help. We will look to run lab drop-in sessions in various time zones every week, where you can ask questions and get additional insight. For out of band support, please email us.</p>
    <p>Once you have completed the lab, simply close the browser tab, then move on to the next one &#128522;. The labs will self destruct after 30 days.
    </p><p>You can see additional guidance on the CloudShare documentation site, under “<a href="https://support.cloudshare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051849192-Student-Guides#first-article" title="CloudShare Student Guides" target="_blank">Student Guides</a>”.</p>
    <p><strong>BIG NOTE:</strong> <strong><u>These lab environments are designed to aid your learning.</u></strong> They do NOT have the resources that our documentation mandates you must use in a production Infinity deployment, or even your corporate labs, test or QA environments. We have chosen to compromise on some of the resources available so that we can provide you with a much higher learning experience. This means that you might experience some glitches in quality, or note some alarms raised in your Infinity deployment that you were not expecting. We have made every effort to ensure that your environments are as good as they can be, just be aware that Infinity is simply not designed to run in an environment like this. You will still be able to see how it can be deployed and configured, and make calls using it, so we trust this will not diminish your experience.</p>
    <p>In the worst-case scenario, for example, if your nodes have lost connectivity after your lab has resumed, reboot the nodes via the ESXi host. Yes – switch it off and on again &#128521;! Of course, this is NOT how you should support a production deployment, but it should work nicely for these labs.</p>
    <p>The take-home here is that for your production, QA, test and customer environments, everything that you have learned on the Level 1 track so far is our gospel, and if in doubt, check the technical documentation.</p>
    <p>Once again, if you have any issues, please feel free to drop us an email.</p>
